ListView Icon Spacing by Ulrik Gustafsson

 This is a demo which shows how to control the icon spacing in a listview's
 icon view.

 The demo is an easy to use wrapper around the LVM_SETICONSPACING api message.
 You only need to submit the x, y icon spacing in twips and then the
 code does the rest of it.
